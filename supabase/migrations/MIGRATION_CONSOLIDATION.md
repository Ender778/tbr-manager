# Migration Consolidation Summary

## What Was Changed

The original 7 migration files have been consolidated into 2 clean, well-documented migrations:

### Original Migrations (now in `backup/`)
1. `001_initial_schema.sql` - Complete database schema
2. `002_fix_auth_trigger.sql` - Fixed default shelves trigger
3. `003_remove_problematic_trigger.sql` - Removed the trigger
4. `004_add_move_book_position_function.sql` - First version of move function
5. `005_fix_move_book_position_function.sql` - Fixed temp position logic
6. `006_robust_move_book_position.sql` - ROW_NUMBER approach
7. `007_simple_move_book_position.sql` - DELETE/INSERT approach (final)

### New Consolidated Migrations

#### `001_initial_schema.sql`
Contains the complete database setup:
- All tables (books, shelves, book_positions, tags, book_tags, reading_sessions, user_preferences)
- All performance indexes
- Complete Row Level Security policies for all tables
- Automatic timestamp update triggers
- **Note:** Default shelves are created in application code (not via database trigger)

#### `002_move_book_position_function.sql`
Contains the final, working version of the move_book_position function:
- Uses the DELETE/INSERT strategy from migration 007 (most reliable)
- Avoids unique constraint conflicts completely
- Properly renumbers positions on source and target shelves
- Well-documented with clear comments

## Why This Is Better

### Before
- ❌ 7 files with overlapping/conflicting changes
- ❌ 4 different versions of the same function
- ❌ Trigger created then removed in separate migrations
- ❌ Difficult to understand what the final state should be

### After
- ✅ 2 clean, focused migrations
- ✅ Single source of truth for each feature
- ✅ Clear documentation and comments
- ✅ Easy to understand and maintain

## How to Use

### For Fresh Database Setup
Run migrations in order:
```bash
supabase db reset  # This will run both migrations
```

### For Existing Database
If you already have the old migrations applied, you can safely ignore the new files.
The database state is identical - this consolidation is purely for developer clarity.

## Backup Location

All original migration files are preserved in:
```
supabase/migrations/backup/
```

You can safely delete this backup folder once you've verified the new migrations work correctly.

## Important Notes

1. **Default Shelves**: The application code creates default shelves when users sign up. This avoids the permission issues that triggered migrations 002-003.

2. **Move Function**: Uses the DELETE/INSERT approach because it completely avoids unique constraint conflicts during renumbering.

3. **RLS Policies**: All tables have complete Row Level Security policies ensuring users can only access their own data.

4. **Timestamps**: The `updated_at` column automatically updates via trigger for books, shelves, book_positions, and user_preferences.
